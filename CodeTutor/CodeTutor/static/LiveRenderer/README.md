# tinkerpad

Tinkerpad is an HTML, CSS, & JavaScript scratchpad much like jsFiddle or Codepen. Write your code in the editor and watch your changes live in the preview pane. Features include 'zen-mode' for distraction-free editing with no preview pane visible, a 'split' view with a semi-transparent preview for editing and previewing at the same time, and a 'full' preview mode that hides the editor.

> Tip: When you are in 'split' view just tap or interact with the preview pane to bring it into full brightness.

## Loading and Saving Files in Tinkerpad
When you first open the app a dialog box displays to let you either load the default scratchpad, or load or create a new scratchpad. Just select 'cancel' to load the default scratchpad, or type the name of the scratchpad you want to create, and it will load any saved scratchpads of the same name if it already exists.

Tinkerpad will display a list of saved scratchpads in the dialog. You can access this dialog at any time while you are tinkering by selecting the 'switch' button in the toolbar at the top of the screen.


## About Tinkerpad
I created this tool because there were no simple HTML live-editing tools for iOS, and I wanted to tinker around with CSS and JavaScript when riding the subway. This tool has come in handy, and the localStorage option has proved more reliable than I was anticipating. It's great having all these handy snippets of problems I've solved available weeks after I was originally playing around with them. Looking at my tinkerpad scratchpads now is like a diary of my progress getting better at CSS, and having a tool like this made experimenting with CSS so much easier.

I hope you enjoy using Tinkerpad!
